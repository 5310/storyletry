      ! tooling for Typescrip libraries
      ! how to do monorepo
      ? how to document Typescript types
    ? decide how to extract storyletters into an abstract class
      they have a lot of common code, even if the story bit changes constantly and a lot of custom logic is necessary for each implementation

    ! implementation
    ! end condition
      now, by default, Choice will only run once
        unless an author-provided Edit makes it repeat conditionally
      decided not to generalize test, "story", and edit into a Storyletter abstract class, _yet_
        "story" will continue to change shape depending on the implementation
        the Edit type is an useful interface, but there's no need to formalize the Storyletter class
    ? consider making Choices a class to make resolvers easier to write for Storytelers
