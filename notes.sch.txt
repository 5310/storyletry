* To-do

  * general
    learn
      ! tooling for Typescrip libraries
      ! how to do monorepo
      ? how to document Typescript types
    ? extract storyletters into an abstract class
      they have a lot of common code, even if the story bit changes constantly and a lot of custom logic is necessary for each implementation
      also, have an optional slug why don't you
      ? plan what and how to abstract
      ? write class
      ? refactor storyletters to extend class
    ?90 write a basic story
      demo using repl.it
    ? package housekeeping
      ? learn how to automate readme creation
      ? tag ALL the things

    ? consider making Choices a class to make resolvers easier to write for Storytelers
    ? tests

  ?*` storyletter-choice
    ! implementation
    ! end condition
      now, by default, Choice will only run once
        unless an author-provided Edit makes it repeat conditionally
      decided not to generalize test, "story", and edit into a Storyletter abstract class, _yet_
        "story" will continue to change shape depending on the implementation
        the Edit type is an useful interface, but there's no need to formalize the Storyletter class
